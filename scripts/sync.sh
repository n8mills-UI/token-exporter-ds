# Token Exporter Unified Build Script (v1.5 - Definitive)
# This script is the single source of truth for building all project assets.
# It bundles CSS, intelligently builds different HTML targets, and injects
# reusable HTML partials to ensure consistency across the project.

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# The 'set -e' command ensures that the script will exit immediately if any command fails.
# This is a critical safety measure to prevent partial or broken builds.
set -e

# Define the primary source file for all styles. All paths are relative to the project root.
CSS_SOURCE_FILE="docs/design-system.css"
# Define the name for the temporary, bundled CSS file created during the build.
TEMP_CSS_BUNDLE="temp_css_bundle.css"

# Define the source templates. These are the files you, the developer, will edit.
UI_TEMPLATE="src/ui.template.html"
GUIDE_TEMPLATE="docs/design-system-guide.template.html"

# --- CLEANUP FUNCTION & TRAP ---
# This 'trap' is a powerful Bash feature. It ensures that no matter how the script exits
# (on success or on error), the cleanup function will be called. This prevents
# temporary files from being left in the project directory.
