# Token Exporter Unified Build Script (v1.3 - Self-Documenting)
# This script automates the entire build process for the Token Exporter plugin.
# It bundles CSS and injects HTML partials into template files to generate final assets.

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# Exit immediately if any command fails, preventing partial or broken builds.
set -e

# Define the primary source file for all styles. All paths are relative to the project root.
CSS_SOURCE_FILE="docs/design-system.css"
# Define the name for the temporary, bundled CSS file created during the build.
TEMP_CSS_BUNDLE="temp_css_bundle.css"

# Define the source templates and their final output destinations.
UI_TEMPLATE="src/ui.template.html"
GUIDE_TEMPLATE="docs/design-system-guide.template.html"

# --- CLEANUP FUNCTION ---
# This 'trap' is a powerful Bash feature. It ensures that no matter how the script exits
# (on success or on error), the cleanup function will be called. This prevents
# temporary files from being left in the project directory.
