# Token Exporter for Figma

![Token Exporter Hero Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbmvymdp1/image/upload/v1752106527/Figma_01_sk7ne5.png)

> A simple, powerful Figma plugin to transform your design variables into production-ready code with one click. It's a zero-config alternative to Style Dictionary, designed to make your design-to-development workflow seamless, fast, and error-free.

This project was created by [Nate Mills](https://natemills.me) to solve a common workflow problem for design and development teams.

## The Problem It Solves

Manual token exporting from Figma is slow, error-prone, and creates a disconnect between design and development. Existing tools often lack the flexibility to export for multiple platforms natively. This plugin solves that problem by providing a fast, automated, and multi-format export pipeline.

<br>

## Key Features

* **Multi-Platform Token Export**
    Natively export your tokens to 6 different formats, ensuring your code speaks the language of every platform:
    * **CSS** (W3C Custom Properties)
    * **Swift** (for iOS)
    * **Android** (XML Resources)
    * **Flutter** (Dart)
    * **JSON** (W3C Design Token Standard)
    * **Tailwind CSS** (Theme Configuration)

* **Intelligent Alias Resolution**
    Accurately resolves deeply nested variable aliases to their final, concrete values while preventing infinite loops.

* **Platform-Native Name Sanitization**
    Automatically converts your Figma variable names (e.g., `Spacing/5 (20px)`) into the correct format for each target platform (`--spacing-5` for CSS, `spacing5` for Swift, `spacing_5` for Android).

* **Context-Aware Unit Handling**
    Correctly identifies unitless tokens (like `line-height` or `font-weight`) and applies `px` units to all other numeric dimensions.

<br>

## How It Works

1.  **Organize Your Variables:** Ensure your design tokens (colors, numbers, strings) are organized in Figma variable collections.
2.  **Launch the Plugin:** Open Token Exporter. It will automatically detect and display your collections.
3.  **Filter Token Types:** Use the toggles to select which token types you want to export (Colors, Numbers, States, Text).
4.  **Select Collections:** Choose which variable collections you want to include.
5.  **Choose Formats:** Select one or more export formats from the dropdown.
6.  **Generate Your Tokens:** Click "Package Tokens" to generate and download your perfectly formatted files.

## How to Contribute & Development Workflow

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the project.

### Project Philosophy

This system follows a **"CSS First"** approach. All style changes are made in a single source of truth (`design-system.css`). Due to Figma's security policy, we use an automation script to inject these styles directly into the plugin's UI file.

### ⚙️ One-Time Setup

First, let's get your local environment ready. You only need to do this once.

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you don't already have it, download and install the **LTS** version from the official website. This is what allows your computer to run the project's scripts.
    <br>
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/">
      <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download_Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white" alt="Download Node.js">
    </a>
2.  **Initialize the Project:** Open a terminal in the project's root folder and run `npm init -y` to create your `package.json` file.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** In the same terminal, run `npm install`. This command sets up the environment needed for our scripts.

### 🚀 The CSS Sync Command

After you've made a change to the styles, you need to sync them to the plugin.

> **Key Command:** In your VS Code terminal, just run:
> ```bash
> npm run sync
> ```

This command runs the `scripts/sync-css.sh` file, which automatically finds the latest CSS, and injects it into the plugin's `ui.html` file.

### ✨ The Golden Workflow

| Step | Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. 📝 Edit** | Make all your style changes in **`docs/design-system.css`**. | Your single source of truth. |
| **2. 🔬 Preview** | Open **`docs/design-system-guide.html`** in your browser. | See your changes live without any builds. |
| **3. 🔄 Sync** | Run **`npm run sync`** in your terminal. | Updates the Figma plugin's UI with your new styles. |
| **4. ✅ Verify** | Test the **`src/ui.html`** file in the Figma plugin. | The final check to make sure everything works. |

> **🛑 IMPORTANT**
> Never edit the `src/ui.html` file directly. All your changes will be deleted the next time you run the sync script.

## Project Status

This project is under active development. The [Live Design System](https://n8mills-ui.github.io/token-exporter-ds/docs/design-system-guide.html) always reflects the latest, bleeding-edge version of the styles and components.

The Figma plugin is updated periodically with stable features from the design system. We are currently implementing the automated build process outlined above, which will soon ensure the plugin and the design system are always perfectly in sync.
