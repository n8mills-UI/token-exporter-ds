# Agent Prompts for Token Exporter Project

## ðŸš€ Initial Recovery & Assessment Panel

When restarting Claude, use this master prompt with multiple agents:

### Master Prompt for Project Recovery
```
I need help with the Token Exporter project - a Figma plugin that exports design tokens. We're at a critical juncture migrating from HTML templates to a component-based architecture.

Please assemble the following expert panel to:
1. Review our current state and migration plans
2. Validate the technical approach
3. Execute their specialized parts of the implementation

Required reading for all agents:
- /CLAUDE.md - Project overview and constraints
- /CURRENT-PLAN-TEMPLATES.md - Immediate template functions plan
- /MIGRATION-PLAN-REACT.md - Long-term React migration strategy
- /docs/design-system.css - Current CSS architecture
- /src/ui.template.html - Plugin UI code
- /scripts/check.js - Our validation systems

Key constraints:
- Figma JavaScript restrictions (no optional chaining, template literals in catch)
- Must maintain single source of truth for components
- Design System Guide is the visual reference standard
- Need to support 6 export formats (CSS, Swift, Android, Flutter, JSON, Tailwind)
```

### Agent Panel Assembly

**PHASE 1: Architecture Review Panel**
```
Agents: backend-architect, frontend-developer, devops-automator, rapid-prototyper

Task: Review the template functions approach and React migration plan. Specifically:
- Validate the shared templates.js architecture
- Assess the phased migration strategy
- Identify technical risks and dependencies
- Propose optimizations for the build pipeline
- Ensure Figma plugin constraints are properly handled
```

**PHASE 2: Implementation Team**
```
Agents: frontend-developer, ai-engineer, test-writer-fixer, mobile-app-builder

Task: Implement the template functions system:
- frontend-developer: Create the shared template modules
- ai-engineer: Optimize template generation and transformations
- test-writer-fixer: Build comprehensive test suite
- mobile-app-builder: Ensure export formats work for mobile (Swift/Android)
```

**PHASE 3: Design & UX Enhancement**
```
Agents: ui-designer, ux-researcher, visual-storyteller, whimsy-injector, brand-guardian

Task: Enhance the plugin and documentation:
- Review current UI/UX pain points
- Design improved component layouts
- Add delightful micro-interactions
- Ensure consistent visual language
- Create better onboarding experience
```

**PHASE 4: Quality & Performance**
```
Agents: performance-benchmarker, api-tester, workflow-optimizer, test-results-analyzer

Task: Optimize everything:
- Benchmark current vs new template system
- Load test with 1000+ design tokens
- Optimize build times
- Identify workflow bottlenecks
- Create performance monitoring
```

## ðŸ“‹ Specific Task Prompts

### Component Migration Sprint
```
Agents: sprint-prioritizer, project-shipper, frontend-developer, test-writer-fixer

I need to migrate our component system in a 6-day sprint:
- Day 1-2: Create template infrastructure
- Day 3-4: Migrate high-priority components
- Day 5: Testing and optimization
- Day 6: Ship and monitor

Start by reading /component-diff-report.md to understand which components need work.
Focus on filters-card, progress-animation, and quick-export-card first.
```

### Design System Audit
```
Agents: brand-guardian, ui-designer, analytics-reporter, feedback-synthesizer

Audit our design system for consistency and usability:
- Review /docs/design-system-guide.html
- Check token naming conventions

```

### Plugin Performance Optimization
```
Agents: performance-benchmarker, infrastructure-maintainer, devops-automator

Our Figma plugin needs optimization:
- Current issue: Slow with 1000+ tokens

4. **Use specific prompts** - For focused tasks
5. **Combine agents creatively** - They work well together
6. **Document outcomes** - Each agent should update relevant docs

Remember: The more specific your prompt, the better the results. Always provide context about what's already been tried and what the constraints are.
