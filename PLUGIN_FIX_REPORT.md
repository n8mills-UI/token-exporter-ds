# Token Exporter Plugin Fix Report

## Summary
Fixed critical architectural issues that prevented the Figma plugin from functioning correctly. The main problem was a disconnect between JavaScript state management expectations and the actual HTML structure.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Container Architecture (Critical)
**Problem**: JavaScript expected containers (`export-card-container`, `quick-export-view`, `advanced-filter-view`) that didn't exist.
**Fix**: 
- Removed `_forms-example.html` wrapper (design system demo component)
- Added proper container structure in `ui.template.html`
- Created dedicated containers for simple/advanced view switching

### 2. ✅ Button Event Listeners (Critical)
**Problem**: Export and filter buttons had no IDs, preventing JavaScript connections.
**Fix**: 
- Added `id="export-btn"` to export button
- Added `id="toggle-advanced-mode"` to filter button
- Connected buttons to existing JavaScript handlers

### 3. ✅ Modal Close Functionality (High)
**Problem**: Close button selector mismatch (`.about-close` vs `.about-modal-close`)
**Fix**: 
- Updated JavaScript to use `[data-close-modal]` attribute selector
- Added backdrop click support
- Ensured modal can be closed via button, backdrop, or escape

### 4. ✅ Component Sizing (Medium)
**Problem**: Cards expanded to fill entire container width
**Fix**: 
- Added CSS constraints: `max-width: var(--plugin-width)` 
- Ensures cards stay within 340px plugin width
- Removed 100% width from example containers

### 5. ✅ Icon Stroke Weights (Medium)
**Problem**: Icon buttons in Figma had incorrect stroke weight
**Fix**: 
- Updated CSS selector from `.btn-icon .lucide` to include `.btn-icon [data-icon] svg`
- Now properly applies thin stroke (1.5) to icon-only buttons

### 6. ✅ View Switching Support (High)
**Problem**: Missing `.state-hidden` utility class
**Fix**: 
- Added `.state-hidden { display: none !important; }` to CSS utilities
- Enables proper toggle between simple/advanced modes

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Plugin loads without errors
- [ ] Skeleton loader appears initially
- [ ] Collections load and display correctly
- [ ] Token counts are accurate

### Export Functionality
- [ ] Export button shows correct token count
- [ ] Export button is disabled when no tokens selected
- [ ] All export formats work (CSS, iOS, Android, Flutter, JSON, Tailwind)
- [ ] Progress indicator displays during export
- [ ] Success/error states display correctly

### Mode Switching
- [ ] "Filters" button toggles to advanced mode
- [ ] Advanced mode shows collection list
- [ ] Collections can be selected/deselected
- [ ] "Back to Quick Export" returns to simple mode
- [ ] Token counts update based on selections

### UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Cards maintain 340px width (don't expand)
- [ ] Icon stroke weights are consistent
- [ ] About modal opens and closes properly
- [ ] All buttons have proper hover/active states
- [ ] Theme switching works correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty state displays when no collections
- [ ] Large collection counts display correctly
- [ ] Export errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Memory warnings for large exports

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Figma**: Reload the plugin and test all functionality
2. **Monitor Console**: Check for any JavaScript errors
3. **Verify Exports**: Test each export format with real data
4. **Performance**: Test with large variable collections

## Known Limitations

- Advanced filter view content is dynamically generated (not a static component)
- Export functionality depends on backend `code.js` implementation
- Icon system requires JavaScript to render (won't show in static preview)

## Development Guidelines

1. **Always edit `.template.html` files** - Never edit generated `.html` files
2. **Run `npm run build`** after changes to regenerate files
3. **Use `npm run check`** to validate Figma compatibility
4. **Test in actual Figma** - Browser preview won't show full functionality

The plugin should now function correctly with proper state management, working buttons, and correct UI rendering.
