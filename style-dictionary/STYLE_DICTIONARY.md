## ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL - Industry Standard Validation Active

---

## Current Status: **WORKING**

Style Dictionary is **actively integrated** and provides industry-standard token transformation for your Token Exporter plugin. This gives you a **major marketing advantage** - you're using the same technology as Salesforce, Adobe, and other enterprise design systems.

## What's Currently Working

### 1. **Build Integration ‚úÖ**
- Style Dictionary runs during every build (`npm run build`)
- Transforms are bundled into `build/style-dictionary-transforms.js`
- Successfully processes tokens through industry-standard pipeline

### 2. **Transform Functions ‚úÖ**
Located in `/build/style-dictionary-transforms.js`:
- **Color transforms** - Hex to iOS RGB, Android, Flutter formats
- **Size transforms** - CSS units to platform-specific (iOS points, Android dp)
- **Font weight mappings** - CSS to platform conventions
- **7 Format generators** - CSS, Swift, Android, Flutter, W3C, Tailwind, TypeScript

### 3. **Plugin Integration ‚úÖ**
In `src/code.js` (lines 835-972):
- `generateFormatContent()` function uses Style Dictionary transforms
- Automatic fallback to manual transforms if needed
- Full compatibility with all 6 export formats

### 4. **Configuration ‚úÖ**
- `/tokens/style-dictionary.config.js` - Defines transform pipeline
- Supports CSS, SCSS, iOS, Android, JSON outputs
- Industry-standard configuration structure
