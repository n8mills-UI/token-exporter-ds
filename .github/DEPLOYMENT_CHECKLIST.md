# Deployment Readiness Checklist

This checklist ensures safe and reliable deployments for the Token Exporter project.

## Pre-Deployment Validation

### Automated Checks (CI/CD Pipeline)
- [ ] **Quality Gates Passed**
  - [ ] Figma compatibility check
  - [ ] JavaScript linting (ESLint)
  - [ ] CSS architecture validation
  - [ ] Theme architecture validation
  - [ ] Icon system validation
  - [ ] Component synchronization check

- [ ] **Build Validation**
  - [ ] Plugin UI builds successfully (`src/ui.html`)
  - [ ] Documentation builds successfully (`docs/design-system-guide.html`)
  - [ ] Build size within limits (< 2MB for plugin)
  - [ ] CSS properly inlined (no external dependencies)
  - [ ] No external script references (CSP compliance)

- [ ] **Security Validation**
  - [ ] No high-severity vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
  - [ ] No secrets exposed in code
  - [ ] Dependencies are up to date

### Manual Verification
- [ ] **Functionality Testing**
  - [ ] Plugin loads correctly in Figma
  - [ ] Token export works for all 6 formats
  - [ ] Documentation site renders properly
  - [ ] Theme switching works correctly
  - [ ] Icons display properly

- [ ] **Performance Validation**
  - [ ] Build time is reasonable (< 30 seconds)
  - [ ] Site loads quickly (< 3 seconds)
  - [ ] CSS complexity is manageable
  - [ ] No memory leaks in plugin

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
1. **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch or PR to `main`
2. **Environment**: `staging`
3. **URL**: `https://staging-token-exporter.netlify.app`
4. **Validation**: Automated post-deployment tests

### Production Deployment
1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
2. **Environment**: `production`
3. **URL**: `https://token-exporter.design`
4. **Requirements**:
   - All staging tests passed
   - Manual approval (if configured)
   - Quality gates passed

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate Checks (< 5 minutes)
- [ ] Site is accessible at production URL
- [ ] Basic functionality works (click around)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] CSS loads correctly

### Extended Monitoring (< 30 minutes)
- [ ] Performance metrics are stable
- [ ] Accessibility checks pass
- [ ] SEO meta tags are correct
- [ ] Analytics tracking works

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
- Site is completely inaccessible
- Critical functionality is broken
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance severely degraded (> 10x slower)

### Rollback Process
1. **Immediate**: Use deployment workflow with `rollback: true`
2. **Manual**: Revert last commit and redeploy
3. **Emergency**: Use cached version from CDN

### Communication
- [ ] Notify team in Slack/Discord
- [ ] Create incident issue in GitHub
- [ ] Update status page (if available)
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Testing and validation
- **Data**: Safe to use test data
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks
- **Rollback**: Less critical, can be down briefly

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live user traffic
- **Data**: Real user data, handle carefully
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring required
- **Rollback**: Critical, must be fast (< 5 minutes)

## CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance

### Regular Tasks (Weekly)
- [ ] Review dependency updates
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate performance baselines
- [ ] Review and optimize build times

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Update Node.js version in CI
- [ ] Review and update GitHub Actions
- [ ] Analyze build artifacts and cleanup old ones
- [ ] Review deployment metrics and optimize

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Audit entire CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Review security practices
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization review

## Emergency Contacts

### Development Team
- **Primary**: Project maintainer
- **Secondary**: Lead developer
- **Infrastructure**: DevOps engineer (if different)

### External Services
- **GitHub**: Status at https://www.githubstatus.com/
- **Netlify**: Status at https://status.netlify.com/
- **CDN Provider**: Check provider status page

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Build Success Rate**: > 95%
- **Deployment Frequency**: Track trends
- **Error Rate**: < 1%

### Alert Thresholds
- **Site Down**: Immediate alert
- **Slow Response** (> 5s): Warning
- **Build Failure**: Notification
- **Security Vulnerability**: Immediate alert

## Documentation Updates

After each deployment:
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Document any configuration changes
- [ ] Update environment variables if changed
- [ ] Record deployment time and version

## Success Criteria

A deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Site is accessible and functional
- [ ] No critical errors in monitoring
- [ ] Performance is within acceptable range
- [ ] Team confirms functionality works as expected

## Failure Recovery

If deployment fails:
1. **Stop**: Don't push more changes
2. **Assess**: Understand what went wrong
3. **Decide**: Fix forward or rollback
4. **Execute**: Implement the decision quickly
5. **Communicate**: Keep team informed
6. **Learn**: Document what happened and why
