2. Cross-section consistency review (5 min)
3. Blocker resolution (5 min)

### Cross-pollination Sessions
- Share innovative approaches between sections
- Ensure visual harmony across all 6 sections  
- Coordinate on shared patterns and elements

### Quality Gates
- 50% completion: Consistency review with Brand Guardian
- 80% completion: Technical review with Frontend Developer
- 100% completion: Final integration testing
