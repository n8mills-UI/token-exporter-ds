# Token Exporter Master Plan 2025 (Updated)

## Project Status: Advanced Polish Phase
**Current Sprint**: Design Enhancement (Phase 3)  
**6-Day Sprint Methodology**: All development aligned to 6-day cycles for rapid iteration

## Completed Phases âœ…

### Phase 1: Content Consistency Audit âœ… (Sprint 1)
- Identified component drift between plugin and design guide
- Fixed "Advanced Filtering" â†’ "Filters" text inconsistencies
- Discovered root cause: documentation template had outdated inline components

- Clarified we're NOT using it for runtime generation
- Documented strategy for build-time transformation generation
- Created architecture decision record (ADR-001)
- Established clear boundaries for token transformation approach

### Phase 3: Animation Icon Fix âœ… (Sprint 2)
- Changed `check-circle` to `circle-check-big` for visual consistency
- Icons are semantically correct (rocket for action, check for success)
- Implemented 5-second animation timing across plugin and guide

### Phase 4: ZIP Export Implementation âœ… (Sprint 3)
- Added JSZip library for multi-format downloads
- "All Formats" now creates `design-tokens.zip` containing all selected formats
- Fallback to individual downloads if ZIP creation fails
- Enhanced user experience with single-click multi-format export

### Phase 5: Multi-Select Format UI âœ… (Sprint 3)
- Replaced dropdown with intuitive checkbox interface
- Shows dynamic selection count ("3 formats selected")

### Phase 8: Component Sharing via Template System âœ… (Sprint 5-6)
**MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Solved component synchronization using build-time includes

**Implementation**:

- Plugin and design guide now use identical component partials
- All components source from `/src/components/_*.html`
- Build system processes includes for both plugin UI and documentation
- Single source of truth for all UI components established

**Templates Using Shared Components**:
- `src/ui.template.html` - Plugin UI with component includes
- `docs/design-system-guide.template.html` - Documentation with includes
- Automatic synchronization on build

### Phase 9: Build System Consolidation âœ… (Sprint 6-7)
- Consolidated all build operations into single `scripts/build.js`
- Integrated CSS bundling, JavaScript bundling, and template processing
- Added watch mode for development (`npm run dev`)
- Established clear separation between source and generated files
- Build system handles Figma CSP requirements automatically

### Phase 10: Agent Workspace Organization âœ… (Sprint 7)
- Created `.dev/agents/` workspace for development tools
- Organized planning documents in `.dev/agents/plans/`
- Added specialized build scripts in `.dev/agents/scripts/`
- Established demo environment in `.dev/demos/`
- Created comprehensive agent documentation system

### Phase 11: Critical Elements Protection âœ… (Sprint 8)
- Implemented `scripts/critical-elements-check.js`
- Validates icon visibility and rendering integrity
- Protects theme switching functionality
- Checks for dangerous CSS selectors that could affect plugin UI
- Prevents regression in core JavaScript initialization patterns

### Phase 12: Icon System Improvements âœ… (Sprint 8)
- Consolidated all icons into single system (`_icon-system.html`)
- Removed external icon library dependencies
- Added build-time validation for icon references
- Implemented JavaScript runtime injection for Figma CSP compliance
- Created comprehensive icon validation script
